<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Every second counts when a child goes missing. Every moment, minute or hour that passes is like a ticking time bomb...This is why Find Our Missing aims to boost searches for missing children by disbursing the information to as many people as possible within the shortest time. At Find Our Missing, we are dedicated to bringing the joy back to families by reuniting them with their lost children. Find Our Missing boosts search efforts for missing children by sharing photo posters and issueing alerts to a broad audience through our website and social media platforms. Whether one is a concerned adult or child, you can reach us through our toll free number 0700 000 000.</p>

<h3>Our Vision</h3>
