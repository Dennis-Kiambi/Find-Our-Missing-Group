<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Every second counts when a child goes missing. Every moment, minute or hour that passes is like a ticking time bomb...This is why Find Our Missing aims to boost searches for missing children by disbursing the information to as many people as possible within the shortest time. At Find Our Missing, we are dedicated to bringing the joy back to families by reuniting them with their lost children. Find Our Missing boosts search efforts for missing children by sharing photo posters and issueing alerts to a broad audience through our website and social media platforms. Whether one is a concerned adult or child, you can reach us through our toll free number 0700 000 000.</p>

<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>We work to ensure that all children are safe from abductions, and that when lost, they can be reunited with their families within the shortest time possible.</p>

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>To make the world a better and safe place for all children.</p>
<h3>Our History</h3>
<p>Disturbed by the agony of parents of missing children, our founder, Mr Dennis Michael Muturi, decided to do something about it. After a lot of deliberation, he founded Find Our Missing four years ago. After the first successful reunion of a lost child to her fmily, Mr. Muturi was determined to keep going. Since then, Find Our Missing has helped reunite hundreds of missing children with their families, and the organization has grown from just a few volunteers to 23 volunteers across Kenya.</p>
