<h2>Testimonials</h2>

    <h3>Peris Mwende</h3>
    <p>The day my househelp called me to inform me that my son, Jason, was missing was the longest day of my life. Suddenly, everything went dark and my legs gave way. Three of my colleagues accompanied me to my home to assist with the search efforts. We reported to the police, but unfortunately, we did not have enough funds to place notice on local media, so when a friend mentioned Find Our Missing, we were quick to try it. I logged into the website and submitted Jason's details and a recent photo. Within a few hours, the photo had circulated to a broad audience and more people were on the lookout. After what seemed like an eternity, we received a call from someone who had found my son. I can never forget how great it felt to have him in my arms again, and i am forever grateful for Find Our Missing for the great work.

    <p>The worries, frustrations, and pain of a parent when a child is missing is unexplainable. When our son went missing, our lives were brought to a rude halt. Junior was only 4 when he wandered off our apartment and into the streets. For days we looked for him without success, and our family was never the same again. Our hearts were filled with agony, our eyes were always wet from tears, and nothing seemed to make sense anymore. Just when we were about to give up, a friend mentioned Find Our Missing to us, and we quickly uploaded Junior's details on the website. Within two hours, his photo had reached a much broader audience, and when the call informing us that he had been found finally came through, we all cried tears of joy and relief. I thank Find Our Missing for helping us find Junior, and saving our family.</p>

    <h3>Liz Wandia</h3>
    <p>Our little girl, Amani, had been missing for three weeks before we finally found her. She had gone to visit her aunt in the city, but unfortunately lost her way when she was sent to the nearby shop. For weeks, we were filled with worries, wondering what happened to our little girl, and if we would ever see her again. Our prayers to see our daughter again were answered when Find Our Missing helped us find Amani. Turns out that someone had seen her photo on Find Our Missing website, and spotted her in a local shopping center where an old woman was housing her. That phone call took away our weeks of mysery, agony and tears. I am forever grateful for their assistance and quick response, and even though Amani is a big girl now, I am still afraid to let her our of my sight. Thank you Find Our Missing for the great work you are doing. </p>
