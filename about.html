<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>When a child goes missing, every moment, every second, and every minute counts. The faster the information reaches people, the more the chances of finding the child. At Find Our Missing, we realize this and are dedicate to getting information about missing children to a broad audience and within the shortest time possible. Parents, sibling, and other concerned parties can report a missing child through our <strong>Toll Free number, 0700 000 000</strong>, or by submitting their details to our website. We collaborate with the local police, administrations and the community at large to find missing children and reunite them with their families.</p>

<h3>Our History</h3>
<p>Having witnessed the pain of a missing sibling firsthand, our founder Mr Dennis Muturi, ws determined to do something to change the situation for other people in the same situation. This is how Find Our Missing was born. Having been established four years ago, Find Our Missing has helped reunite hundreds of children with their families. From working single handedly, the group has now grown and partners with the local police force, other organizations and the community at large to help rescue lost children. The workforce of the organization has grown from just 1 person, and we now have 27 volunteers situated in different parts of the country.</p>
